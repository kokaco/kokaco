#Known formula 3N+1 = Write a Python program where 
#you take any positive integer n, if n is even, 
#divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply 
#it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process 
#until you reach 1.

		if (n % 2) == 0: #if num1 even
			n = int(n/2)
		else: #if num1 odd
			n =int(3*n+1)
	return n
